# Social Media Backend

I developed a Advanced Social Media Backend using JavaScript, Node.js, NestJS and TypeScript, seamlessly integrating user authentication with versatile CRUD functionalities, including innovative features like OTP verification via email and post likes. This comprehensive system not only streamlined registration and login processes but also empowered users to effortlessly manage their posts. MongoDB serves as the database, and Mongoose is utilized as the ODM, ensuring efficient data management and scalability. Beyond the fundamental operations, the platform featured advanced elements such as friend requests, automated post scheduling through cron jobs, and a dynamic commenting system and cloudinary for Cloud Image saving . This holistic approach underscores a commitment to delivering a secure, engaging, and feature-rich user experience.
