Welcome to BlogNest , a robust blog backend powered by NestJS and Mongoose. Users experience seamless authentication with JWT tokens, unlocking the power to create, read, update, and delete posts. Our intuitive API provides dedicated routes for posting, liking, and retrieving posts, ensuring a dynamic and engaging blogging experience. Notably, only the author of a post has the privilege to update their content, guaranteeing the integrity of each user's unique contributions.

To test the API endpoints, use Postman and refer to my Postman Collection in the blognest workspace :
